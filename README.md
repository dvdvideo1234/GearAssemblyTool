<br>
<br>This is a Gmod tool for assembling Gears 
<br>
<br>I made this thing, because I am pissed of mesing my gears over and over and ... you get the idea xD
<br>
<br>Spawn gears by clicking anywhere 
<br>
<br>Shift stacks gears for making differentials and stuff. 
<br>
<br>You can constrain your gears using the drop-down menu 
<br>
<br>Anchor prop to constrain spawned gears to is selected via Shift+Right mouse 
<br>
<br>Other setings are pretty much like the Track Assembly Tool 
<br>
<br>Destribution ownership is like the Track Assembly Tool, so DO NOT UPLOAD THIS TO ANY OTHER SITES ! 
<br>
<br>I mean it !
